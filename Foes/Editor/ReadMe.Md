# Foe Editor

This is the Foe Editor used by Star Story II. It stores its data in GINIE format in the data directory and is able to generate .Neil source files for the game itself to use.

Please note that due to the level set up that Star Story II uses for its enemies, this editor may feel a bit odd, and may require some study to get full understanding of.
The "Mascot.png" file will NOT be included in the repository. Place any PNG of your own there if you like to get the editor properly compiled.
Please note that "TrickyUnits" is required to get this on the run. I merely took my own file system into account by setting this up, so things may not be really nice on you.

The editor may be used under the terms of the GPL3 license. The data has its own license based on its importance to the story line. Please check the data files themselves for that.
