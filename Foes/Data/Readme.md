# Star Story II Foe data

In this folder you will find the data files on which the enemy data in Star Story II in generated.
Please note I created folders for the kind of enemy (Bosses have their own folder apart from regular enemies) for my own organisation.

The files can have their own license set up depending on their importance in the game. Be sure to check that out.

The data in this repository is most of all present for evaluation and study purposes and not really for your own use.
The editor may be used under the terms of the GPL3.
